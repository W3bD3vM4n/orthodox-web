  "US_CONTENT_P1": "The Orthodox Church is the original Church founded by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ around 33 AD. Since then the legitimate successors of the Apostles, the Bishops, have maintained this Holy Faith without change or corruption in the Orthodox Church. The Autonomous Orthodox Metropolis of Ecuador and Latin America is an Eparchy that received its autonomy from the Holy Greek Orthodox Church (ΓΟΧ - Γνησίας Ορθόδοξος Χριστιανός) and is part of the Holy Hierarchical Synod (GOC), and administered by His Eminence Metropolitan K.K. Chrysostomos, its territory covers all of Latin America, i.e. 20 countries, mostly Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking, with similar cultural roots. Thus forming a Pan-Orthodox entity (with faithful of different ethnic groups who, due to immigration, are in this territory and enrich the experience of the Orthodox faith for Latin Americans). ",
  "US_CONTENT_P2": "With an area of 21'069.501 km and about 569'000.000 inhabitants. Probably the largest existing territory for an Orthodox Metropolis in the world, but at the same time the most neglected, little and poorly attended by the large jurisdictions known as Orthodox. Therefore, in a heroic manner and at the same time criticized by some, the new Autonomous Orthodox Metropolis of Ecuador and Latin America offers the unique opportunity to unify the Latin American Orthodox without falling into the currently widespread errors of Sergianism, Ecumenism, and despotic ethnicism (Philetism). ",
  "US_CONTENT_IMPORTANT": "“Neither an ecumenical council, nor the Patriarchate of Constantinople, nor the Patriarchate of Moscow, nor any other Mother Church, cannot create a new local Church”. ",
  "US_CONTENT_P3": "What they can do is to recognize that church. But the act of creation must be done in situ, locally. Higher Authorities can guide, confirm and proclaim. But the creative work can only be done at the local level, as living Eucharistic cells (communities around a bishop who celebrates the Eucharist) are called to gradually constitute themselves into a new body of a new local Church.",
  "US_QUOTE": "- Metropolitan Kallistos (Ware) of Diakleia, SOP 302, November 2005, lecture delivered at the St. Serge Institute of Theology in Paris",
  "MISION_TITLE": "Mission",
  "MISION_CONTENT": "The MISSION of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolis (GOC) of Ecuador and Latin America, is first of all to believe and fulfill the command of Christ “Go into all the world making disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you”, so that all peoples will be saved through the knowledge and life of the Truth of our Lord Jesus Christ. Preaching according to the Divine Will, the full Gospel of the Kingdom of God that has come to Latin America inviting all believers to live their faith according to the Orthodox Doctrine of the Church. Using our jurisdiction all the languages used by the people of this territory. So that the Body of Christ in Latin America may be unified and live according to the true traditions of the Holy Orthodox Church which is enriched by all the ethnic customs of different nationalities. Witnessing to the truth and by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit, reveal to all the way of salvation and eternal sanctification.",
  "VISION_TITLE": "Vision",
  "VISION_CONTENT": "The Orthodox Church, being present in Latin America for more than a century, wept for the lack of pastors who distribute the sacraments faithfully according to the Orthodox Tradition, but also for the lack of serious diffusion of the Orthodox Church Doctrine in an efficient and multiplying way. Old and erroneous ideas hindered the Orthodox Church in Latin America, presenting it as not evangelizing or worse, only aimed at rescuing the souls of foreigners who were born in our faith and who for different circumstances came to live in Latin American territory. Many times these orthodox and practicing communities were closed and self - condemned to disappear. Today, thanks to the support of the Holy Hierarchical Synod (GOC), we have a jurisdiction that is totally open to the Latin American cultural and ethnic reality, through the Bishops canonically consecrated for this service, to the current evangelization and pastoral, without any discrimination, being multiethnic and pluritraditional communities that are united in a single Orthodox faith, lived in Latin America. Open to orthodox foreigners and Latin Americans, without any kind of exclusion. Our present and future vision of the Orthodox Church in Latin America is full of hopes and challenges that with God's grace we will fulfill, feeling called to the definitive establishment of our Church in Latin America, living in the canonicity and traditions, with its own expression as it is given in all Orthodox jurisdictions.",
  "GODMAN_GOD_TITLE": "God",
  "GODMAN_GOD_P1": "The Orthodox Church teaches that we have knowledge of God, only because God has shown himself to his creation. The main doctrinal point about creation is that God alone is uncreated and ever-existing. Everything which exists besides God was created by him.",
  "GODMAN_GOD_P2": "God is absolutely holy, this means literally that He is absolutely different and unlike anything or anyone else that exists. He is so unique and so perfect that his existence cannot be compared to any other existence. God is absolutely transcendent, “what He is, by essence and nature, is altogether beyond our comprehension and knowledge.”",
  "GODMAN_QUOTE_1": "- John of Damascus",
  "GODMAN_GOD_P3": "Orthodox doctrine holds that God's unity or oneness is also not merely the mathematical or philosophical concept of “one”. The Church teaches God as the Trinity. One God, three persons, Father, Son, And Holy Spirit, each of whom 'dwells' in the other two, by virtue of a perpetual movement of love. God is not only a unity but a union.",
  "GODMAN_GOD_P4": "It is the Church's teaching and its deepest experience that there is only one God because there is only one Father. The Son is born from the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father, both in the same timeless and eternal action of the Father's own being. What the Father is, the Son and the Spirit are also. They share the divine nature with God the Father, being “of one essence” with him.",
  "GODMAN_GOD_P5": "Every attribute of divinity which belongs to God the Father: life, love, wisdom, truth, blessedness, holiness, power, purity, and joy, belong equally as well to the Son and the Holy Spirit.",
  "GODMAN_MAN_TITLE": "Man",
  "GODMAN_MAN_P1": "Man is God's special creature. He is the only one “created in the image and likeness of God” (Genesis 1:26). It is the Orthodox doctrine that one can understand and appreciate what it means to be human only in the light of the full revelation of Jesus Christ (Romans 5:14).",
  "GODMAN_MAN_P2": "Thus the holy fathers of the Orthodox faith taught that whatever stage of maturity and development man attains and achieves, whatever his power, wisdom, mercy, knowledge, love, there continually remains before him an infinity of ever-greater fullness of life in the most blessed Trinity to be participated in and lived. The fact that human nature progresses eternally in perfection within the nature of God constitutes the meaning of life for man, and remains forever the source of his joy and gladness for all eternity.",
  "GODMAN_QUOTE_2": "- Fr. Thomas Hopko, The Orthodox Faith Volume I, Doctrine",
  "CHURCH_TITLES": "In One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church",
  "CHURCH_CONTENT_P1": "The Christian Church is the assembly of God's chosen people, called to keep His word and do His will and work in the world and in the Heavenly Kingdom.",
  "CHURCH_CONTENT_P2": "In the Holy Scriptures the Church is called the Body of Christ (Romans 12; I Corinthians 10:12; Colossians 1) and the Bride of Christ (Ephesians 5:22-33; Revelation 21:2; 22:17). It's also compared to the living Temple of God (Ephesians 2; I Peter 2), and is also called “the pillar and bulwark of the Truth” (I Timothy 3:15).",
  "CHURCH_ONE_TITLE": "One",
  "CHURCH_ONE_P1": "The Church is One, and can never be fragmented since its unity depends on God and He is One, because Christ and the Holy Spirit are also One. There can only be one Church, and not many.",
  "CHURCH_ONE_P2": "Orthodox Christians believe that in the historic Orthodox Church, there is the full possibility of full participation in the Church of God, and that only human sins and false doctrines (heresies) separate men from this unity.",
  "CHURCH_HOLY_TITLE": "Holy",
  "CHURCH_HOLY_P1": "The Church is Holy, because God is Holy, because Christ is Holy, and the Holy Spirit is Holy, and the Holiness of the Church comes from God. The members of the Church are holy insofar as they live in communion with God. In the earthly Church, human beings participate in the Holiness of God.",
  "CHURCH_HOLY_P2": "The faith and life of the Church on earth is expressed in the teachings, the sacraments, the offices, the scriptures and the saints who keep the essential unity of the Church, and who can certainly be affirmed as “holy” by the presence and action of God who is in them.",
  "CHURCH_CATHOLIC_TITLE": "Catholic",
  "CHURCH_CATHOLIC_P1": "The Orthodox Church is also “Catholic” because of its relationship to God, Christ and the Holy Spirit. Sometimes the catholicity of the Church is understood in terms of universality in time and space. However, this word points more to a quality than to a quantity. It is to define how it is, that is, full and complete, all-encompassing, and lacking nothing. Only God is that full and complete reality; only in God is nothing lacking.",
  "CHURCH_CATHOLIC_P2": "Even before the Church expanded throughout the earth, it was already defined as Catholic. The original Church of Jerusalem, the Church of the Apostles, or those early Churches in cities such as Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, or Rome, were Catholic. These Churches were Catholic -just as each of the Orthodox Churches is today- because they lacked nothing essential to be the true Church of Christ.",
  "CHURCH_APOSTOLIC_TITLE": "Apostolic",
  "CHURCH_APOSTOLIC_P1": "The Church is called “Apostolic”, describing the mission of being “sent” to fulfill a task. First, because it is founded on Christ (John 12:49) and the Holy Spirit sent by God and on the apostles sent by Christ, filled with the Holy Spirit (John 20:21-22); and second, because the Church, in its earthly members, is sent by God to bear witness to His Kingdom, to keep His word, to do His Will and to accomplish His work in the world.",
  "CHURCH_CONTENT_P3": "Orthodox Christians believe in the Church because we believe in God, Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Church itself is the object of faith as the divine reality of the Kingdom of God given to men by Christ against which “the gates of hell shall not prevail” (Matthew 16:18).",
  "CHURCH_CONTENT_P4": "There cannot be a perfect and full communion with God, in the midst of a fallen and sinful world, without the Church as a divine, mystical, sacramental and spiritual reality. The Church is God's gift to the world. It is the gift of salvation, of knowledge and enlightenment, of forgiveness of sins, of victory over darkness and death. It is the gift of Communion with God through Christ and the Holy Spirit. This gift is given totally, once for all, without any reservation on the part of God. It endures forever, to the end of time: invincible and indestructible. Men may sin and fight against the Church, believers may separate from the Church, but the Church itself remains forever.",
  "BIBLE_TITLE": "Bible",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P1": "The Bible is a collection of texts about God's Revelation, also known as the Holy Scriptures.",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P2": "It was written over the course of thousands of years by many different people. It's divided into two “testaments” or “covenants”. The two testaments are the Old and the New; each has its own writings. As a book, the Bible contains many different types of scripture: law, prophecy, history, poetry, narratives, aphorisms, prayers, letters and symbolic visions.",
  "BIBLE_TITLE_OT": "The Old Testament",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P3": "The Old Testament writings begin with the Five Books of the Law. Also called the Pentateuch (meaning Five Books) or Torah (meaning the Law), they are referred to as the Books of Moses, since they focus on the Exodus and the Mosaic Laws.",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P4": "In the Old Testament there are also books about the history of the people of Israel, such as I and II Kings and I and II Samuel; the Wisdom books, such as Psalms, Proverbs and Job; and books of prophecies that bear the names of the prophets of the Old Testament. A prophet is someone who publicly professes the Word of God by direct divine inspiration. Generally many people think of a prophet as someone who foretells the future, but this is only its secondary meaning.",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P5": "The Orthodox Church counts among the authentic books of the Old Testament the books called Deuterocanonical (other Christians place these books in second place or reject them completely as not inspired).",
  "BIBLE_TITLE_NT": "The New Testament",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P6": "The heart of the New Testament is made up of the four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who are called the Evangelists. The word Gospel comes from the Greek, -Evangelion-, which means “Good News”.",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P7": "It also contains the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, written by St. Luke. In addition, we find fourteen Epistles (which simply means “letters”) attributed to St. Paul the Apostle. However, it is possible that some, such as the Epistle to the Hebrews, were not written directly by him. Also found in the New Testament are three epistles written by the Apostle John; two by the Apostle Peter; one attributed to the Apostle James and another to the Apostle Thaddaeus (Jude). Finally, there is the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse, attributed to St. John.",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P8": "For the Orthodox Christian, the Bible is the primary written source of Divine Doctrine, since God Himself inspired its writing by His Holy Spirit (see II Timothy 3:16 and II Peter 1:20). This is the doctrine of the inspiration of the Bible; that is, that men inspired by God wrote words which are truly their own human words (all words are human), but which nevertheless may be called, as a whole, the Word of God. Thus the Bible is the Word of God in written form for it contains not only the thoughts and experiences of men, but the Revelation of God Himself.",
  "BIBLE_CONTENT_P9": "The center of the Bible is the person of the Living Word of God in the guise of man, Jesus Christ. All parts of the Bible are interpreted in the Orthodox Church in the light of Christ, for everything in the Bible leads to Christ and speaks about Him (Luke 24:44). This is symbolized in the Orthodox Church by the fact that only the Book of the Four Gospels is enthroned on the Altar, and not the entire Bible. This is so because all that is in the Bible is fulfilled in Christ.",
  "LITURGY_TITLE": "Liturgy",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P1": "Liturgy means a common work or action of a particular group of people for the good of all. While Church means an assembly of people called together to do some common work. When the members of the church gather as the People of God to worship, this assembly is called the Divine Liturgy of the Christian Church.",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P2": "The liturgy of the Old Testament people was the official worship in the temple in Jerusalem according to the Law of Moses, as well as the annual feasts and fasts, and the private prayers and services performed by the Israelites in their homes or in the synagogues. By definition, the Synagogues are houses of assembly or prayer; they are not temples, since according to the Mosaic Law there was only one temple in Jerusalem where the priestly worship was celebrated. The Israelites gathered in the synagogues for prayer, study of the Scriptures, preaching and contemplation of God's work.",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P3": "In the New Testament Church the liturgy is centered on the person of Christ. It is primarily a “Christianization” of the liturgical life of the Old Testament. ",
  "LITURGY_IMPORTANT": "The Christian Church preserves the liturgical life of the Old Testament, but in a new and eternal perspective. ",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P4": "So that the Old Testament prayers, scriptures and psalms are read and sung in the light of Christ. The sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ replaces the Old Testament sacrifices in the Temple. And the Lord's Day, Sunday, replaces the ancient Jewish Sabbath which was celebrated on Saturday.",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P5": "The Jewish feasts also receive a new meaning in the Christian Church. The central feast of Passover, for example, is now the celebration of the Death and Resurrection of Christ; and the feast of Pentecost becomes the celebration of the coming of the Holy Spirit that fulfills the Old Testament Law. The Christian liturgical year is also shaped according to the Old Testament prototype.",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P6": "From the original basis of the Old Testament liturgy, the Church developed its own sacramental life, with Baptism in the Name of the Holy Trinity, Chrismation (or Confirmation), Holy Communion, Matrimony, Repentance (Penance), the Sacrament of the Sick and Holy Orders, taking on specifically Christian forms and meanings. A wealth of specifically Christian prayers, hymns and blessings were also developed, along with Christian feasts and celebrations commemorating events and saints of the New Testament.",
  "LITURGY_CONTENT_P7": "The living experience of Christian liturgical and sacramental life is a principal source of Christian doctrine. In the liturgy of the Church, the Bible and Holy Tradition come alive and are offered to the Christian people as an experience to be lived. Thus through prayer and sacramental worship, human beings are “taught by God”, as was foretold for the messianic age (John 6:45).",
  "SAINTS_TITLE": "Saints",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P1": "A saint is one who is holy, that is, set apart for God's service. It is a person who has cooperated with God's grace to the extent that his or her holiness is beyond doubt.",
  "SAINTS_BIBLE": "Saints in the Bible",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P2": "In the Holy Scripture, the word saint is used to refer to those who have been set apart for the service of God, consecrated for his purposes. As such, all members of the Church are called saints, regardless of their personal holiness or sinlessness. It is still appropriate to use the term in this way.",
  "SAINTS_CHURCH": "Saints in the Church",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P3": "Aside from the more general use of the word saint to refer to all members of the Church, Holy Tradition also ascribes Saint as a title to particular persons whose lives have shown most clearly what it means to follow Jesus Christ. These saints are popularly glorified (canonized) by the Church, often in the modern era with a formal service to recognize and affirm the veneration of them by the faithful.",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P4": "Saints are not thought of as either perfect or infallible, and it is only because of the work of Christ in them that the Church venerate these people. It is because we see our Lord's countenance reflected most clearly in their faces that we publicly laud them, ask them to pray for us, and encourage one another to follow their examples.",
  "SAINTS_RECOGNITION": "Recognition of Saints",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P5": "From the beginning, the Church recognized the righteous ancestors of Christ, as grace-filled men and women whose lives were pleasing to God. Also the prophets who predicted Christ's coming and the apostles and evangelists who proclaimed the Gospel were assumed to be saints.",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P6": "Next the martyrs and confessors who risked their lives and shed their blood in witness to Christ were also recognized as saints. In time, ascetics who followed Christ through self denial, were numbered among the saints.",
  "SAINTS_CONTENT_P7": "Bishops and priests who fought against heresy and proclaimed the true faith are recognized by the Church as saints. Today, people perfect in goodness and righteousness, in all walks of life, can be recognized as saints.",
  "CLERGY_TITLE": "Clergy",
  "CLERGY_CONTENT_P1": "It's the term used to describe the formal religious leadership within the Orthodox Christian Church. Orthodox clergy take care of the ritual aspects of the religious life of the Church, teach, or otherwise help in spreading Orthodox doctrine and practices. They often deal with life-cycle events such as child birth, baptism, marriage, and death.",
  "CLERGY_CONTENT_P2": "The term “clergy” as generally used in the Orthodox Church applies to those who are members of the major orders and are ordained. Those who assist the clergy in the services of the church and are tonsured are referred to as members of the minor orders. The clergy status in the Orthodox Church is reserved for males.",
  "CLERGY_CONTENT_P3": "Those of the major orders are the bishops, priests, and deacons, the same offices identified in the New Testament (1 Timothy 3:1-2) and found in the early church. Bishops are usually drawn from the ranks of the monks and are required to be celibate. Priests, deacons, and subdeacons may be married, provided that they are married before their ordination to the subdiaconate.",
  "CLERGY_CONTENT_P4": "Each ordination must take place in this order: reader, subdeacon, deacon, priest, bishop.",
  "CLERGY_CONTENT_P5": "Nuns, on the other hand, are members of the monastic community and are dedicated to a life of prayer, asceticism, and service. While they play an important role in the spiritual life of the church and often engage in various ministries, they do not perform sacramental duties like the clergy.",
  "LAITY_TITLE": "Laity",
  "LAITY_CONTENT_P1": "The laity comprises any person who is not a member of the clergy or of any monastic order. In the Orthodox Church, the laity are the people of God and are responsible for preserving the integrity of the faith as much as the bishops.",
  "LAITY_CONTENT_P2": "The laity are called to live by the same Christian moral standards as the clergy. They both are expected to participate in all the worship services and keep the various days and seasons of fasting and feasting. The clergy are the sacred priesthood, where the laity are among the royal priesthood. The clergy cannot conduct formal worship services without the participation of the laity, and the laity can not perform the same services without the clergy to lead them. Each play a very important role in the liturgical and administrative life of the Church.",
  "LAITY_CONTENT_IMPORTANT": "The organization of the Orthodox Church is both hierarchical and conciliar (or synodal). ",
  "LAITY_CONTENT_P3": "It is hierarchical in that priests, deacons, and laymen are expected to follow their bishop and to do nothing without their bishop, in that Jesus Christ is the head of every bishop. It is conciliar or synodal in that there is no single superior position whom all the bishops follow, but rather the bishops meet together in synods or councils and reach binding agreements through consensus. A bishop, even the patriarch, is bound to obey the decisions of his synod. A council with representatives from all the churches is an ecumenical council."
